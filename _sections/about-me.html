<p>I am a research data specialist at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at TU Delft in the Netherlands. My academic backgrounds lie in historical literature and information science, and I use these to explore the ways we connect to heritage in the digital world as well as how to empower people to approach historical cultures on their own terms. At the heart of my work are the concepts of discovery, identity and storytelling, and I try emphasize the values of empathy, privacy and authenticity.</p>
<p>I have a particular interest in making historical culture more accessible online, but I am also interested in exploring digital methods for understand and preserving artifacts, monuments and intangible materials. If you are looking for a design partner for a project like this, please get in touch!</p>
