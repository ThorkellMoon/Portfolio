<p>At present I find myself peering behind the wizard's curtain at topics relating to data, design and cultural heritage at the faculty of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/">Industrial Design Engineering</a> at TU Delft in the Netherlands. My academic backgrounds lie in historical literature and information science, and I draw on these to explore the ways we connect to heritage in the digital world as well as how to empower people to approach historical cultures on their own terms. Major themes in my work include discovery, ambiguity, identity and storytelling - the narratives drawn around why people value heritage and how it is experienced or appreciated. Buildings, art and archives are infinitely interesting, and I want everyone to have the ability to make and recognize personal connections with them. The affordances of the digital world open up novel means for interacting with shared heritage, and I busy myself with imagining how these might be designed in ways that preserve and promote empathy, privacy and authenticity.</p>
<p>I have a particular interest in making historical textual culture more accessible and personalizable online, but I am also interested in exploring digital methods for understanding and preserving artifacts, monuments and intangible materials. Discussions for collaborations in designing projects such as these are always welcome.</p>
